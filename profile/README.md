# ASE Graz GitHub Organisation for contributing to OpenSCD and CoMPAS

OpenSCD and CoMPAS are both open-source tools used in the power systems industry, specifically for configuring and managing digital substations.

OpenSCD is a tool for editing and visualizing SCL (Substation Configuration Language) files, which define how devices in a substation communicate and work together.

CoMPAS (Configuration Management for Power Automation Systems) builds on top of this by managing and validating those configurations across different projects and teams.

In simple terms: OpenSCD lets you "draw and edit" how a digital substation should be set up, while CoMPAS helps you "organize and control" those drawings in a safe and standardized way. They work together to make designing and managing substations easier, more consistent, and less error-prone.
