# ASE Graz GitHub Organisation for contributing to OpenSCD and CoMPAS

OpenSCD and CoMPAS are both open-source tools used in the power systems industry, specifically for configuring and managing digital substations.

- OpenSCD is a tool for editing and visualizing SCL (Substation Configuration Language) files, which define how devices in a substation communicate and work together.

- CoMPAS (Configuration Management for Power Automation Systems) builds on top of this by managing and validating those configurations across different projects and teams.

In simple terms: OpenSCD lets you "draw and edit" how a digital substation should be set up, while CoMPAS helps you "organize and control" those drawings in a safe and standardized way. They work together to make designing and managing substations easier, more consistent, and less error-prone.
